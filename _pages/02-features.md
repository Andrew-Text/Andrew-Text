          Ever wanted to review a text conversation from a while ago? On the iPhone by the time you finish repeatedly scrolling up and hitting “Load More Conversations,” they’ll have invented a new model that makes yours obselete and unhip. No more! AllYourTexts lets you easily navigate all your text conversations, see conversations statistics, and copy and paste information from your text history.

      <p>If you have contacts who text you from several different numbers, AllYourText can show you all of those conversations in a single view so you don’t have to keep switching from number to number to see all your communications with someone.
